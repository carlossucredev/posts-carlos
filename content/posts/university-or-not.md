# University or not?

This question has been bothering me for many days, and I want to respond to it. However, it also reminds me of other questions I've asked myself when making important decisions in my life, for example: do I have to move to another city to get a job? Should I get married?  Should I continue playing baseball, or should I give up? Should I move to another country?

I have always answered these questions based on my context and every time these questions take up a lot of my time, not just when I was actively thinking about it, but also when I shouldn't be thinking about it (at work, at school, on the way anywhere), when I have one important decision in my head, my brain uses a lot of processing power until I make the decision, and don't tell me I should write this down somewhere to free my memory, trust me, I already tried. So I need to make the decision fast and correctly.

## What is the best decision?

Now I should make a decision "studying or not at university?" and the purpose of this post is not make a decision but rather learn how to think, what to think to reach the best decision.
