# University or not?

This question has been bothering me for many days, and I want to respond to it. However, it also reminds me of other questions I've asked myself when making important decisions in my life, for example: do I have to move to another city to get a job? Should I get married?  Should I continue playing baseball, or should I give up? Should I move to another country?

I have always answered these questions based on my context and every time these questions take up a lot of my time, not just when I was actively thinking about it, but also when I shouldn't be thinking about it (at work, at school, on the way anywhere), when I have one important decision in my head, my brain uses a lot of processing power until I make the decision, and don't tell me I should write this down somewhere to free my memory, trust me, I already tried. So I need to make the decision fast and correctly.

## What is the best decision?

Now I should make a decision "studying or not at university?" and the purpose of this post is not make a decision but rather learn how to think, what to think to reach the best decision.

And here's what I've learned after making all those decisions — moving cities, changing sports, leaving a country:

There is no universally best decision. There is only the best decision **for your context, right now, with what you have.**

So when I ask myself "university or not?" I stop trying to find the right answer and start asking better questions:

What door specifically does a degree open for me that I can't open another way? What's the real cost — not just money, but time, opportunity, momentum? And honestly — am I considering this because I believe it moves me forward, or because I'm afraid of what people will think if I don't?

That last question is the one that cuts through everything.

I've seen people with CS degrees unemployed and people without them leading engineering teams. The degree was never the variable. The variable was always **how clearly they understood what they were building toward.**

So no, I'm not going to tell you whether to go to university or not. That's not my decision to make.

What I will tell you is this: if the answer isn't clear yet, you're probably still asking the wrong question.

Keep asking. You'll get there.
